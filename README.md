''' I am someone who really likes programming. My preferred language of choice
is python. I spend anywhere from 6 - 8 hours a day researching and practicing
programming concepts. I have a machine that I use as a dedicated server which
provides me with the ability to access files anywhere, use a SQL db remotely,
run scripts, play with apache, create flask applications and a whole host of
other fun things. Linux is my preferred os and, at present, I run manjaro
	natively on three different machines of mine.I have tried many different flavors
of linux, my first of which was slackware in 97-98 and then after the concept
of linux live cd's, starting with knoppix, blew my mind I shifted to debian
based distros. Now I found myself feeling alot more comfortable on arch based
systems. I like that arch based systems, such as manjaro, have a small footprint
and are highly customizable I also like the package manager pacman alot.
I dont consider myself a linux expert, even though I should be based on all the
years ive used linux.'''
